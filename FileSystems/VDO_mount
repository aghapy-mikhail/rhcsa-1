Question: Use the un-partioned disk and make its size of 50 GB mounted persistently on /vdomyvdo

Solution:

# Check which device is un-partioned
lsblk 

# Partition the disk
fdisk /dev/sdc

lsblk 

# make sure the needed packages and service is enabled 
yum install vdo kmod-kvdo

systemctl enable --now vdo

systemctl status vdo

# Check command in vdo man page
man vdo

vdo create --name=myvdo --device=/dev/sdc1 --vdoLogicalSize=10T

# Don't forget -K option
mkfs.xfs -K /dev/mapper/myvdo 

mkdir /myvdo

vim /etc/fstab 
    /dev/mapper/myvdo	/myvdo		xfs	defaults,x-systemd.requires=vdo.service	0 0

df -h
mount -a
df -h
systemctl daemon-reload 

# Reboot and verify
reboot 
df -h

# Optional
# We can mount using systemd also

cd /etc/systemd/system
