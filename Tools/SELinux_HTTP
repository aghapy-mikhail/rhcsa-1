Question: A HTTP web server running on non standard port 82 is having issues serving content. 

          Debug and fix the issues.
          i) The web server on your system can server all the existing HTML files from /var/www/html ( NOTE: Do not make any changes to these files ).
          ii) Web service should automatically start at boot time.


Solution:

# Find the sealert messages
grep -i sealert /var/log/messages

# Copy the command from the logs
seleart -l <HASH_CODE>

# Run the suggested command given in the message of the above command

# Finally enable httpd service
systemctl enable --now httpd
